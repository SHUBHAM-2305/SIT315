Simple Sense-Think-Act Board

Overview
This project is a Sense-Think-Act system implemented using an Arduino Uno, an HC-SR505 motion sensor, and both the built-in LED and an external LED as actuators. The system detects motion, processes the input, and responds by turning on/off the LEDs accordingly. The serial monitor is used to display the system status.
